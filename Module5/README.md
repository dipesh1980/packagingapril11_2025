<details>
<summary><strong>📏 Set Die Thickness</strong></summary>

Set the thickness to:


</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔗 Add Bond Pads</strong></summary>

- Create bond pads on both the die and the substrate.
- These serve as electrical connection points for wire bonding.
- Assign appropriate material properties, typically metallic:
  - **Gold**
  - **Aluminum**

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔌 Establish Wire Bond Connections</strong></summary>

- Use the **Bondwire** tool.
- Connect die pads to substrate pads using **gold wire**.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>📦 Incorporate Mold Compound</strong></summary>

- Add a rectangular mold compound structure to encapsulate:
  - The die
  - Associated wire bonds
- Set the thickness to:
  
- Assign mold material properties such as:
  - **Epoxy Molding Compound**
